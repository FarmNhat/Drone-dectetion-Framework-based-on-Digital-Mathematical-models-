GEOTOP-RADAR COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS REPORT v3.0
NOW WITH PHASE COHERENCE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

[GENUINE] HIGH CONFIDENCE: GENUINE

DETAILED CONFIDENCE: 95.0% (VERY_HIGH) - VERY RELIABLE

FILE INFORMATION:
  File: drone_0737.csv
  Processing time: 10.68s
  Signal length: 8000 samples (2.00s)
  GeTop Readiness: 0.344 - MODERATE: Signal has some structure but may be challenging

STAGE 4: PHASE COHERENCE ANALYSIS (ENHANCED)
  Phase Coherence Score: 0.664
  SNR: 25.8 dB
  Confidence: 58%
  Result: GENUINE - Good phase coherence
  Reason: LFM signal with good phase linearity (linearity: 0.99, R²: 1.000), Poor Jacobi coherence, Good LFM linearity

DECISION FACTORS:
  1. [STRONG] Strong camouflage anomaly (score: 0.90)
  2. [INFO] HTS PROTECTION: Verified Rotational Topology
